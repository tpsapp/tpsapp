### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer focusing on full-stack development.  I love learning, building stuff to solve problems, and teaching others how to do the same.

I have been programming since I was in 5th grade starting with a Tandy Color Computer III using Extended Color Basic and moved on from there.  I have learned C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Pascal, Perl, PHP, and Python in various stages over the years and am fairly proficient with them all.  I also work with HTML, CSS, SQL, and various frameworks that go with them.  My favorite things to create are web based apps and web sites, android applications, and software written in c#.
